          <h3>Scaffolding out our Project</h3>
          <p>
            Now that we have Django installed, we can get started by setting up the project.
          </p>
          <h4>Replit Setup</h4>
          <p>
            To setup the project on Replit, go to the homepage, click "Create Repl", and use the Django template. After
            you've done this, you should see an editor. However, we still cannot run the project yet, as Django projects
            require a random secret key, which isn't generated by Replit. To generate it, open the Shell tab, which can
            be found on the right, next to the console. Then open an interactive Python shell by typing
            <code>python3</code> into the shell. From there, input the following into the prompts:
          </p>
          <pre>import secrets<br>secrets.token_urlsafe(32)</pre>
          <p>
            Copy the output minus the quotes, and then find the Secrets button, which should be in the bottom left
            corner. There, type "SECRET_KEY" on the left, and paste the output on the right. This will allow our Django
            project to use this new key. Once this is done, click the run button to start the Django project. You should
            see a webview pop up, confirming everything works.
          </p>
          <h4>Computer Setup</h4>
          <p>
            To set up our Django project on a computer, navigate to the directory where we created the virtual
            environment. Activate this virtual environment. From there, run the following command to create a new Django
            project:
          </p>
          <pre>django-admin createproject ByteClubBlog</pre>
          <p>
            This will create a folder called ByteClubBlog inside our virtual environment. This folder will contain all
            our project code. You can enter this folder by running <code>cd ByteClubBlog</code>. Then, run the following
            command to start the server locally:
          </p>
          <pre>&lt;python command here&gt; manage.py runserver</pre>
          <blockquote>
            From now on, I'll be using the Linux command for Python. Whenever you see <code>python3</code>, just replace
            it with the Python command your system uses.
          </blockquote>
          <p>Something like this should appear:</p>
          <img src="img/4_djangofirstruncli.png" alt="A terminal showing text output of the following command">
          <p>You should be able to click on the link, or type the address into your browser and see the result:</p>
          <img src="img/5_djangofirstrun.png" alt="The default Django webpage">
          <blockquote>
            The address <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a special one, as it refers to your local computer. You can replace it
            with <code>localhost</code> in the URL bar and nothing will change. This is because <code>localhost</code>
            also refers to your computer.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            From now on, you can start your Django server like this. To stop it, simply type <kbd>CTRL+C</kbd> in the
            terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, open this folder in your favorite code editor. I generally recommend <a
              href="code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> for beginners, but you can use any you like. I myself
            will be using Neovim. And now, we can almost get to coding!
          </p>
          <h3>But First Some Explanation</h3>
          <p>If you examine the the file structure, you'll see something like this:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/6_djangoprojectstructure.png" alt="The folder structure in a Django project">
          </figure>
          <p>Here is what each file does:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>manage.py</code> helps us the developer interact with the project, like running it, setting up
              the database, and creating applications</li>
            <li>The inner <code>ByteClubBlog/</code> directory is the entry point for the website</li>
            <li>
              <code>__init__.py</code> is just an empty file that makes it so Python treats our project like a module
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>settings.py</code> is where all of the settings for our website live, like any applications we
              create (which we will), the location of our static files (images, Javascript, CSS) and database
              configuration
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>asgi.py</code> and <code>wsgi.py</code> are boilerplate code that is useful when deploying our code
              to production. We don't really have a need to mess with it. For now just understand that it is important
              when deploying our website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>urls.py</code> is where some of our URL routing lives. As you may remember, when our website
              receives a GET requests, the <code>urls.py</code> file points it to the matching view to receive a
              response. This <code>urls.py </code> file is project-wide. While we could use it to match every URL to a
              view, it is much more common to delegate it to particular applications.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            A website may have multiple components, such as a home page, a profile page, a blog page, etc. Django lets
            you group the code for similar pages together in applications. For example, we will group everything that
            has to do with blogging functionality in a blog application, and everything that has to do with users in a
            users application. Each application has it's own views, and database schemes. We will touch on this later
            on.
