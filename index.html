          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! If you are reading this, that means the task of rewriting the Byte Club website has fallen to you.
            This tutorial will teach you how to create dynamic web apps using Python and the Django framework.
            What do I mean when I say dynamic websites? That just means that they can have posts created by a user.
            For example, YouTube is dynamic, because it lets its users create and view posts, as well as update
            them, and delete them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern is so common, it even has its own acronym. <abbr title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr>,
            which stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. And yes this acronym sucks.
          </p>
          <h3>How?</h3>
          <p>To understand how Django works, you first must have a basic understanding of how websites work</p>
          <figure style="width: 300;">
            <img src="img/1_diagram.png"
              alt="a diagram showing the client making a web request and the server returning HTML">
            <figcaption>Note: Client refers to the browser used by the user</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This is how static websites work. The client sends a GET request, which tells the server to <em>get</em> a
            specific resource, in this case, an HTML document. Static websites, unlike dynamic websites, cannot receive
            posts created by
            users. They simply display the same text each time they are requested by the browser. For example, this site
            is a static site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We, of course, are not interested in making static sites. It's much more interesting to build the next
            YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram, then it is to just render the same text over and over again. Here is how
            dynamic sites work:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/2_diagram.png"
              alt="a diagram showing the client making a web request to a URL of a specific post and the server processing it, then returning HTML ">
          </figure>
          <p>
            This is how the R in CRUD works. The server finds the post that the user requested in the DB (developer
            lingo for database), and then, using HTML templates stored on the server, fills in the details, kind of like
            filling out a form. Once the template is completely filled out, (which happens in less than a second) the
            server then sends the finished HTML over to the client, where it can be rendered (AKA, the browser displays
            it).
          </p>
          <p>
            The processes for the C, U, and D are slightly more involved. When creating a post, the user fills
            out a form with all the details for said post, like text, images, etc. Once they are done, the server uses
            the data in this form to send a POST request, which tells the server to create a new
            database entry. Updating is similar, except instead of a POST request, the client sends a PUT request, which
            tells the server to <em>put</em> the new info in the old DB entry. When it comes to deleting
            posts, the client sends a DELETE request, and the server deletes the corresponding DB entry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's how it it comes together in Django (for the R in CRUD):
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/3_basicdjango.png" alt="a diagram showing a Django codebase">
          </figure>
          <p>
            It might look a bit confusing at first, so I'll explain it. The <code>urls.py</code> file serves as an
            entryway. It takes the user's GET request and sends it over to the view that corresponds to the URL of the
            request in <code>views.py</code>, which is in charge of returning HTML responses for that specific URL. The
            view then gets data using the <code>models.py</code> file. This file contains code that lets us access the
            database the way we want. Once the code in the <code>views.py</code> file has received the appropriate data
            from the database, it uses an existing HTML template to format it. Once this is done, it gets sent over to
            the user as HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            That might seem really complicated to do, but it's actually a breeze to do in Django. And once you know how
            to work with Django, it's easy to make brand new ideas. So, without further explanation, lets get started on
            replacing the Byte Club website.
